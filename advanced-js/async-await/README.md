# async/await

The async and await keywords in JavaScript provide a more concise and readable syntax for working with Promises. 

- **async** - The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function.
- **await** - The await keyword is used to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject.

This makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous code.
